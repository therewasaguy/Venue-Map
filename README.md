Venue-Map
=========

Map local venues. Click for a list of upcoming artists. Coming soon:
- Local radio for upcoming events in a metro area and at a specific venue
- Geolocation + search to set location (NYC only for now) 
- Create 'venue playlists' like Downtown Free Jazz or Brooklyn Hardcore by listing favorite venues
- Browse other people's venue-based playlists.

Using Songkick + Google Maps API's, will add Echo Nest and Spotify soon to generate local radio. The API keys aren't on my github.
